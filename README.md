# Learning-Go

This project is used as my personal play ground for learning Golang. 

There are different folders / packages. Some of them are mentioned below. 

- DataStructs (This package has all the learnings/programs and test cases related to various data structures)
  - Queue
  - Stack
  - Linked List
  - Graphs
  - Trees
 
- leet (This package has various problems that I did based on leetcode.com. I try to include references to the original problem in leetcode. But, some might be missing them). This package also has detailed test cases for most of the problems. 

- stringmanipulation1 (This package includes various problems, trials that I worked on while learning how to handle string, bytes and runes in Golang). There are many unit test cases associated with them as well.
